Everything in JS happens in Execution Context

JS is synchronous single-threaded language

Execution Context has two parts: 
    - The first one is the memory component or the variable environment where everything is stored in key-value pairs. 
    - The other one is the code component, where the actual code is stored. It is also called Thread of Execution.

Difference between undefined and not-defined in JS

What is window? Global object created with global execution context.
